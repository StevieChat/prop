NOTE: This program requires you to have the Java Runtime Environnement installed (JRE) you can find this by google "java jre download" or by following this link: https://java.com/en/download/

When you open the program for the first time it'll open a File Browser, you're supposed to navigate to your PoE folder and select "Client.txt". The default location for this is C:\program files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Path of Exile\logs for the Steam version and C:\program files (x86)\Grinding Gear Games\Path of Exile\Logs for the stand alone.

A video showcasing the program will be uploaded in a little bit on https://youtube.com/pastillage
